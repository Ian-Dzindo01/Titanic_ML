# Titanic_ML
This is a repo for the Titanic competition from Kaggle.
This code was built on the foundations of this kernel:https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions.
The code provided by Manav Sehgal helped me out a lot. I used that code as a guideline while coding up my own script.
This is not the final version. There are improvements coming in the close future.
